## Predicting Sea Level Rise Using Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning, and its Impact on Global Economy
### Author: Hermann J Fan

  Global warming is no longer a new term for us. Based on the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report, there will be 15 major cities in the world under the risk of being submerged by the sea after 2030. This research will use Time Series Analysis methods to predict future trends in sea level rise and uncover any seasonality patterns influencing these changes. The study will focus on New York City and Shanghai as financial supercities, analyzing the potential economic impacts of sea level rise using datasets and machine learning models like ARIMA. Key metrics like RMSE and MAE will evaluate the model's performance. This research aims to help policy makers in planning for mitigation and adaptation.

## What is the project trying to solve? Why is this important?
  The global warming is elevating sea level globally, and threatening the safety of major citeis, such as New York City, NY; Miami, FL; and Shanghai China. Residents safety should always be the first place for governors to work on. In this reasearch and analysis, I will use several visualizations on Geographical data to explain the risks in different region, and it's economical impact to those regions. 
  Additionally, global trade is the key to secure the free market of the world. If the major cities NY and Shanghai are submerged by the sea, that wouldn't be a good news for global trade and economy. The safety of citizens is not only physical safety, but also the safety of their properties, right to trade, and stability of the society.

## Data collection and refinement: Where did the data come from? How did it need to be refined?
  My data collection: 
- **NYC OPENDATA**: "This is the 500-Year Floodplain for the 2050s based on FEMA's Preliminary Work Map data and the New York Panel on Climate Change's 90th Percentile Projects for Sea-Level Rise (31 inches). Please see the Disclaimer PDF for more information. Data Provided by the Mayor's Office of Long-Term Planning and Sustainability (OLTPS) on behalf of CUNY Institute for Sustainable Cities (CISC) and the New York Panel on Climate Change (NPCC)." **Reference Website**: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Sea-Level-Rise-NYC/7353-4pk9.
  - Refinement: The geographical data should be refined and cleaned for plotting and visualization.

*For the Dataset of Shanghai, most of the data are properly kept by the Shanghai City Government. Consequently, their report will be my main source to predict and analyze the data.*
