Global warming is no longer a new term for us. Based on the IPCCâ€™s Sixth Assessment Report, there will be 15 major cities in the world under the risk of being submerged by the sea after 2030. This research will use Time Series Analysis methods to predict future trends in sea level rise and uncover any seasonality patterns influencing these changes. The study will focus on New York City and Shanghai as financial supercities, analyzing the potential economic impacts of sea level rise using datasets and machine learning models like ARIMA. Key metrics like RMSE and MAE will evaluate the model's performance. This research aims to help policy makers in planning for mitigation and adaptation.
